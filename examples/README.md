# BSP Examples
This directory contains source files of examples provided with the Board Support
Packages (BSPs).

These are distributed to the BSP crates using the `manage` tool, which does some
simple transformation to e.g. replace `{{bsp}}` in the example names with the
specific BSP as it is copied to the BSP crate.  `manage` is configured through
`examples.toml`, which can be used as a reference to see which BSPs support
generic examples.

## Naming
Example files are named using `bsp-example_name.rs`, where `bsp` is either a
specific BSP crate name, or `generic` to indicate that `examples.toml` will
contain a list of BSPs that support the example.
